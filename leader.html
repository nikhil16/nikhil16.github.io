                <p class="lead">Who is a Leader?</p>
				<p>At the most basic level, a leader is someone who leads other.A leader has a vision. Leaders see a problem that needs to be fixed or a goal that needs to be achieved. It may be something that no one else sees or simply something that no one else wants to tackle. Whatever it is, it is the focus of the leader's attention and they attack it with a single-minded determination.</p>
				<p>According to the idea of transformational leadership, an effective leader is a person who does the following:</p>
				<ul><li>Creates an inspiring vision of the future.</li>
					<li>Motivates and inspires people to engage with that vision.</li>
					<li>Manages delivery of the vision.</li>
					<li>Coaches and builds a team, so that it is more effective at achieving the vision.</li>
				</ul>
				  
				<p class="lead">What is leadership?</p>
				<p>What does leadership mean? Every Person wants to be a good leader, but how can you be a good leader if you don't know what leadership really is?Unfortunately, leadership doesn't have a one-size-fits-all definition. We all have our own ideas about what it means to be a good leader. For example, some people think leadership means guiding others to complete a particular task, while others believe it means motivating the members of your team to be their best selves. But while the definitions may vary, the general sentiments remain the same: leaders are people who know how to achieve goals and inspire people along the way.</p>
				<p>There are Various definations of leadership. Some of them are:</p>
			    <ul><li> "Leadership is having a vision, sharing that vision and inspiring others to support your vision while creating their own."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is the ability to guide others without force into a direction or decision that leaves them still feeling empowered and accomplished."</li>
					<li>"Effective leadership is providing the vision and motivation to a team so they work together toward the same goal, and then understanding the talents and temperaments of each individual and effectively motivating each person to contribute individually their best toward achieving the group goal."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is the art of serving others by equipping them with training, tools and people as well as your time, energy and emotional intelligence so that they can realize their full potential, both personally and professionally."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is being bold enough to have vision and humble enough to recognize achieving it will take the efforts of many people â€” people who are most fulfilled when they share their gifts and talents, rather than just work. Leaders create that culture, serve that greater good and let others soar."</li>
					<li>"A true leader is secure in creating a framework that encourages others to tap into their own skills and ideas and freely contribute to the whole of the project or company."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is knowing when to be in front to lead and guide a team during the journey, and when to step back and let others take the lead. Much like an athlete who knows exactly what position to move to on the field at any given time, a true business leader understands the delicate balance of how to help others become leaders, fuel career ambitions, then give them the chance to shine."</li>
					<li>"Too many people view management as leadership. It's not. Leadership comes from influence, and influence can come from anyone at any level and in any role. Being open and authentic, helping to lift others up and working toward a common mission build influence. True leadership comes when those around you are influenced by your life in a positive way."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is when someone is willing to stand up front to be either the target or the hero to take responsibility for the success or failure of a given goal. Not everyone has the guts to be a leader and the [take] personal risks that they may encounter."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is stepping out of your comfort zone and taking risk to create reward."</li>
					<li>"A leader is someone who has the clarity to know the right things to do, the confidence to know when she's wrong and the courage to do the right things even when they're hard."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is the behavior that brings the future to the present, by envisioning the possible and persuading others to help you make it a reality."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is caring more about the cause and the people in your company than about your own personal pain and success. It is about having a greater vision of where your company is trying to go while leaving the path open for others to grow into leaders."</li>
					<li>"A leader is a person who takes you where you will not go alone."</li>
					<li>"Leadership means using one's influence to help guide others in successfully achieving a goal without desire for recognition, without worry of what others think and with awareness of issues, internal or external, that might change the results sought."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is not about finding ways to lead better or to motivate your team. It's about being there from the beginning as equals and becoming a mentor when they need you to be one."</li>
					<li>"Leadership styles differ, but at the core, good leaders make the people they are leading accomplish more than they otherwise would. The most effective leaders do this not through fear, intimidation or title, but rather by building consensus around a common goal."</li>
					<li>"A leader is a mix of a visionary and a left brainer â€” an inspiration to others who uplifts one to walk beside him, not behind him. A leader lets go of his/her ego and taps into his soul, consistently stretching himself, challenging himself, growing within."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is inspiring others to pursue your vision within the parameters you set, to the extent that it becomes a shared effort, a shared vision and a shared success."</li>
					<li>"Leadership in the business world requires harnessing the energy and efforts of a group of individuals so that their outlook is advanced from an unremarkable Point A to a very desirable Point B â€” from bad to good, slow to fast, red to black. During that process, leadership manifests in projecting your expertise in a way that gains the confidence of others. Ultimately, leadership becomes about trust â€” when that confidence inspires them to align their vision and level of commitment for the betterment of the company."</li>
					<li>Leadership is an act â€” a decision to take a stand, or step, in order to encourage, inspire or motivate others to move with you. What's more, the most effective leaders do not rely on their title, or positional power, to lead. Rather, their ability to use their own personal power combined with their use of strategic influence are what make them effective."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is the ability to take an average team of individuals and transform them into superstars. The best leader is the one who inspires his workers to achieve greatness each and every day."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is influencing others by your character, humility and example. It is recognizable when others follow in word and deed without obligation or coercion."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is actions committed by a person or group that produce an output or result. It simply helps people to get things done. It is not based on position in a hierarchy."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is the collective action of everyone you influence. Your behavior â€” your actions and your words â€” determines how you influence. Our job as leaders is to energize whatever marshals action within others."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is the ability to inspire motivation in others to move toward a desirable vision. While management is focused on tasks, leadership is focused on the person. All in all, the best leadership drives change and long-lasting motivation."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is simply causing other people to do what the leaders want. Good leadership, whether formal or informal, is helping other people rise to their full potential while accomplishing the mission and goals of the organization. All members of an organization who are responsible for the work of others have the potential to be good leaders, if properly developed."</li>
					<li>"Leadership is employing your skills and knowledge, leveraged by your attitude to get the results you desire."</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="lead">Leadership skills Required</p>
					<p>Beyond the personal traits of a leader, there are specific skills someone must master if they want to be a leader.</p>
					<ul><li><b>Effective communication - </b>it's more than just being able to speak and write. A leader's communication must move people to work toward the goal the leader has chosen.</li>
					    <li><b>Motivation - </b>a leader has to be able to motivate everyone to contribute. Each of us has different "buttons". A leader knows how to push the right buttons on everyone to make them really want to do their best to achieve the leader's goal.</li>
					    <li><b>Planning - </b>the leader has a plan to achieve the goal. He/she doesn't get too bogged down in the details, that's what managers are for, but rather uses a high level plan to keep everyone moving together toward the goal.</li>
					</ul>
