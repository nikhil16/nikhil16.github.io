                <p class="lead">Manohar Aich is an Indian bodybuilder.</p>
			</div><!-- end tagline -->
                <p>Manohar Aich (born March 17, 1914) is an Indian bodybuilder. He was born in Comilla District (now in Bangladesh) in a remote village named Dhamti. He was the second Indian to win the Mr Universe title. 
				   He did so in the 1952 Mr. Universe - Group III championship. He is also a three-time Asian Games gold medalist in body building. Being only 4 feet 11 inches (approximately 1.50 m) tall, he was given the name "Pocket Hercules".His chest measured 54 inches (140 cm) with a waist of 23 inches (58 cm). He currently lives in Baguiati.
				</p>
				<h1>Early Life</h1>
				<p>Since childhood he was interested in strength related sports, such as wrestling and weight-lifting. At the age of 12, due to a sudden attack of black fever, his health broke down. He regained his strength, however, by physical fitness exercises. He started bodybuilding exercises such as doing push-ups, squats, pull-ups, leg raises, and traditional sit-ups. 
					He only did bodyweight/calisthenics exercises with up to 100 reps per set at that age. He attended the Jubilee School in Dhaka. While at school, he used to go to the Ruplal Byayam Samiti for physical exercises. He began to perform in shows titled Physique and Magic along with P. C. Sorcar in Dhanbad. He used to perform feats like bending steel with his teeth, bending spears with his neck, and resting his belly on swords.
			   </p>
			   <h1>Career</h1>
				<p>The diminutive Manohar Aich, who is 4ft 11ins tall, overcame many hurdles to achieve his body building glory. Born in the small town of Comilla in Bengal, he was attracted to exercising and building his muscles when as a schoolboy he saw a group of wrestlers in action.
				    Aich joined the Royal Air Force in 1942 where he began his pursuit in bodybuilding. He was introduced to weight training by Reub Martin, a British officer at the RAF.
					Aich earned praise for his physique from his peers in the air force. By that time, however, he had built his structure with prolonged hard work and dedication. Due to his physique, he was highly praised by the then British officials in the Royal Air Force. 
					While working at the Royal Air Force, Aich was imprisoned for slapping a British officer in protest of the officer's remark in favour colonial oppression. 
					Aich began his weight training seriously while in jail.He said: 'It was in that jail that I began weight training seriously. This helped me prepare myself for the world championship. 'In jail I used to practice on my own, without any equipment, sometimes for 12 hours in a day.'
				</p>
				<p>He would spend hours in physical exercises. The prison authorities were so impressed with his perseverance and hard graft he was given a special diet to help build his stamina and it was India’s independence in 1947 that led to Aich’s release. Not taking life too seriously: Former Mr Universe Manohar Aich says the key to a long life is not letting stress get the better of you.
					Dogged by poverty, Aich and his wife struggled to put their four children through school. There was little cash to indulge his passion for body building, but Aich took up odd jobs to earn a little on the side.
					His 1950 win of a 'Mr. Hercules' contest spurred him to set his sights on the Mr. Universe tournament in London and a year on Aich came second in the contest.
					He decided to stay in London to prepare for another shot at the title and to India with the crown after bagging the title in 1952.
					What followed were a host of awards, including top positions in Asian Body building Championships, and his more popular title of 'Pocket Hercules' due to his small frame.
					Six decades later, Aich still heads to the gym to help his sons run a fitness center and spends his days guiding juvenile hopefuls to reach the heights of body building that he did.
					A minor stroke last year has robbed him of the ability to lift weights, but he keeps a watchful eye on young body builders training in his gym.
				</p>
				<p>Although his two sons did not take up body building, Aich says his mentoring has earned him many rewards. It has produced India’s eight-time national champion, Satya Paul, while another protege, Premchand Dogra, scooped the Mr. Universe title in 1988. MR UNIVERSE: THE CHAMPIONS YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH. </p>
				<p>Despite tough times and his tireless efforts to make it as a muscle man Aich says his ability to take his troubles lightly and remain happy are the secrets to his long life.
					That, and a simple diet of milk, fruits and vegetables along with rice, lentils and fish have kept him healthy. He does not smoke and has never touched alcohol, he said.
					'I never allow any sort of tension to grip me. I had to struggle to earn money since my young days, but whatever the situation, I remained happy' Sitting in a room decorated with posters and pictures of his many bodybuilding triumphs today he said that he did have one regret however.
					That he never had a chance to meet his more famous counterpart, and fellow Mr Universe winner, Arnold Schwarzenegger. But Aich says he’s seen many of Schwarzenegger’s action films.
				</p>
				<p>'I like the incredible stunts he does in the movies,' he added. His children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren gathered yesterday in the eastern city of Kolkata to celebrate his birthday the day before. Hindu priests chanted prayers while a feast was laid out to honour him. </p>
