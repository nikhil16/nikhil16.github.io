                <p class="lead">Mahavir Singh Phogat is a former Indian Wrestler and Coach. </p>
			</div><!-- end tagline -->
                <p>Lying on a wooden charpoy, playing cards and discussing local issues with men from the village as they pass around a tall brass hookah, Mahavir Phogat is quite the leader. Economical with his words, the 54-year-old's ample girth gives a hint of the once-promising wrestler who had trained at Delhi's famed Chandgi Ram Akhara.
					This is the tale of a man, whose determination to fight a Dangal, both on the mat and outside it, has given India three champion women wrestlers Geeta, Babita and Vinesh Phogat, commonly known as the Phogat sisters.
					Mahavir has brought about a minor revolution in gender equations in a state, which is almost legendary for the poor status of its women. Haryana has the lowest sex ratio among states and an abysmal female literacy rate of 60.02%. Amidst all this, the success story of Phogat sisters of Balali, an obscure little village in Bhiwani district, is rare indeed.
					"He (Mahavir) always wanted chhoris (daughters). I was the one who wanted a son," says Daya Kaur, Mahavir's wife. "Geeta and Babita were trained right from their childhood. He was firm and wanted the girls to become national-level wrestlers, at least," she adds.
					The couple has five children, four girls and one, the last born, son, and Mahavir is training all of them. While Geeta and Babita have already made it big, Ritu is an upcoming star. Sangita and Dushyant are still training under their father's hawk eye. Vinesh, the family's other CWG gold medal winner, is a cousin, the daughter of Mahavir's younger brother Rajpal, who died many years ago.
					Ironically, it is the girls of the family who have done well, not the boys. Three boys from Mahavir's close-knit, extended family Anoop, his wife's nephew, Harnam, Vinesh's brother, and Rahul, his younger brother Sajjan's son?had joined his training sessions, but they couldn't take the strict regimen and rebelled, or had to drop out because of injuries.
					It isn't just his own family, several girls from Balali and nearby villages have also turned to Mahavir for training, especially in the months following Geeta and Babita's triumph. So is there a wave of female liberation blowing through this tiny village with no primary health centre and only one senior-level government school? You know the answer.
				</p>
				<h1>Breaking barriers on his own</h1>
				<p>Reminiscing the days of hardships that he had to go through while shaping the careers of Geeta and Babita, Mahavir says, "My father, Man Singh, was a renowned pehelwaan (wrestler) and I wanted to continue the rich tradition of our family. When Geeta turned five, I thought of introducing her to wrestling and gradually started training her. I knew women's wrestling was quite popular in western countries, but it barely had any existence in India.
					"I thought my girls can lead the country in women's wrestling if I train them properly. So I taught them all the tricks that I knew and then took them to local dangals. But they were not allowed to fight and I was warned to not bring my girls to the dangals, which the villagers said were fiefdom of boys. My family and I were ostracized from the society, due to this move," recalls Mahavir, who then decided to further train the girls on his own and later took them to Sports Authority of India's (SAI) Sonipat centre. "There the coaches saw the talent in Geeta and Babita and took them under their wings. The rest as they say is history and the girls have made me proud. Now, after Geeta and Babita's achievements, the people, who had boycotted me, have made me the sarpanch," adds Mahavir, with a sense of bitterness in his voice.
					Mahavir has also built a gymnasium and bought hi-tech gym equipment that the girls need to train on. A state-of-the-art wrestling mat, lent to the girls by a local college, lies in one half-a-large hall, which acts as the training centre. "Wrestling mats are expensive and I have written several times to the state government to provide me with one, but nothing has happened," reflects Mahavir. "I have built this training centre and gymnasium with my own money never got any financial support."
			   </p>
			   <h1>The Mercenary Fighter</h1>
				<p>During the 80s, Mahavir was a mercenary wrestler and the king of dangals. Having learnt the tricks of pehelwaani from his father, Mahavir was a much sought-after fighter. "I used to be invited from different villages to fight dangals. I don't remember losing a fight and gradually became famous. People used to place bets on me winning a dangal. During those days, I won fights ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 50,000.
					"People used to call me from different states, like Punjab, Himachal (Pradesh), Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, to fight dangals. You can say I was a mercenary fighter. At times, there were pehelwaans from different parts of the country, who were double my size and it was really intimidating. But I would win, always," Mahavir signs off with a garrulous smile.
